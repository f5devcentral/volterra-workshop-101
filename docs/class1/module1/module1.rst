Module 1 - Use Case 1 - Expose public application
#################################################

In this section, we will expose an existing and public internet facing application through Volterra Global Network.

The use case is simple:

* An application is already up and running somewhere (Datacenter, public cloud ...)
* This application has a public IP address or FQDN
* We will use and leverage the Volterra Global Network to expose this application
* The application will be available everywhere though all Volterra Regional Edge locations
